🚀 **Introducing dotclaude** - A growing, opinionated collection for Claude Code developers

After working extensively with Claude Code, I've assembled a curated repository of development guidelines, specialized agents, and security tools.

**What's included:**

📋 **CLAUDE.md** - Development guidelines with SOLID, DRY, KISS, and YAGNI principles that Claude automatically follows

🤖 **Specialized Agents** - Pre-configured agents for code quality, debugging, validation, and compliance checking

🔒 **Prompt Sanitizer** - Go-based security tool that detects:
- Zero-width hidden characters
- Direction override attacks
- Homoglyph substitution
- Base64-encoded malicious commands
- Control character obfuscation

**Why this matters:** As AI-assisted development grows, so do the risks of prompt injection and malicious agent configurations. Always scan external prompts before using them.

This is a living collection that grows with real-world usage. Contributions welcome!

**dotclaude - Opinionated Claude Code agents & prompt security scanner**

I've open-sourced my growing collection of Claude Code configurations, agents, and a security tool I built to scan for malicious prompts.

**Repo includes:**

* **CLAUDE.md** - Project-level instructions with SOLID principles that Claude follows automatically
* **Specialized agents** - Code quality checker, debugging agent, compliance validator, etc.
* **Prompt sanitizer** - 214-line Go tool that detects hidden threats in prompts/agents:
  - Zero-width spaces hiding instructions
  - RTL overrides concealing code
  - Cyrillic characters masquerading as Latin
  - Base64-encoded malicious commands

**Why the sanitizer?** With the rise of shared AI prompts/agents, there's a real risk of prompt injection attacks. Always scan before using external configurations.

This is a curated, opinionated collection based on real development workflows. It's actively growing - feedback and contributions welcome.

## Hacker News/Technical

**Show HN: dotclaude - Claude Code agents with security-focused prompt sanitizer**

Repository: https://github.com/ngmisl/dotclaude

A curated collection of Claude Code development guidelines (CLAUDE.md), specialized agents, and a Go-based prompt sanitizer.

The sanitizer (214 LOC, stdlib only) scans markdown/yaml/xml/txt files for:
- Unicode zero-width characters (U+200B, U+200C, etc.)
- Bidirectional text overrides (U+202E, etc.)
- Homoglyphs (Cyrillic 'е' vs Latin 'e')
- Base64-encoded payloads with keyword detection
- Invalid UTF-8 and control characters

Built this after realizing shared prompts/agents could hide malicious instructions invisible to humans but parsed by LLMs. The agent collection includes code quality checkers, debugging agents, and compliance validators.

Opinionated but practical. Actively maintained.

## Discord/Slack Community Message

Hey everyone! 👋

Just open-sourced **dotclaude** - my growing collection of Claude Code agents, prompts, and development guidelines.

🎯 **Highlights:**
- CLAUDE.md with SOLID/DRY/KISS/YAGNI principles
- Pre-built agents for code quality, debugging, validation
- **Prompt sanitizer** - scans for hidden malicious content before you use external agents

🔒 **Why the scanner?**
Prompts can hide instructions using:
- Invisible zero-width spaces
- Text direction overrides
- Look-alike Cyrillic characters
- Base64-encoded commands

It's like a security scanner for your AI toolchain.

Check it out: https://github.com/ngmisl/dotclaude

Feedback welcome! This is a living collection that grows with usage.
